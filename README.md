# The Drawnjuring
Game for INT D 450
Play as G’lich—a pixelated, immortal lich—on a quest to maintain peace and quiet in SGiknea—a prison on a comet wherein you are incarcerated. Your prison mate, arch-enemy, and giant-floating-hand: the "Oodler'' has escaped, leaving behind his ferocious, reanimated doodles, or Oodles! Consume the life forces of your enemies, and raise your own army of the slain in swift retribution. Finally, confront the Oodler and maybe, just maybe, he’ll leave you be (maybe, no promises).
